A cross-platform multiplayer web-based game.

A small project I started a few years ago, the prospects of which have grown considerably since. My intention is to build a real-time multiplayer game that can perform well on multiple platforms, with servers hosting a multitude of players.

The initial project focused on a VB.Net based server and a Flash client using the most of OO ActionScript? 3. I have since decided to rebuild my progress so far with a completely JavaScript? code-base.

The server will be built using Node.js with MySQL, the client using HTML5 with a framework called CreateJS (utilising HTML5 with libraries and tools familiar to Flash developers). While this has been the only project I've ever developed in Flash, I still view this library as a useful tool & abstraction, and the artwork assets I've already created don't have to go to waste.

This has now become part of my Computer Science BSc studies as my third year project. Let's hope I can get close to a completed game in under a year.
