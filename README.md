A multiplayer web-based 2D platform game.

About the project
-----

A small multiplayer game experiment project started in 2012. My intention is to build a real-time multiplayer game that can perform well on multiple platforms, with servers hosting a multitude of players.

The initial project focused on a VB.Net based server and an Adobe Flash client, attempting to make the most of the object-oriented ActionScript 3. I have since decided to rebuild my progress so far with a server and client code-base that only runs JavaScript.

The server will be built using Node.js with MySQL, the client using HTML5 with a framework called CreateJS (utilising HTML5 with libraries and tools familiar to Flash developers). While this has been the only project I've ever developed in Flash and I'm not necessarily dedicated to its conventions, I still view CreateJS as a useful tool & abstraction, and the artwork assets I've already created don't have to go to waste or be remade.

This has now become part of my Computer Science BSc studies as my third year project. Let's hope I can get close to a completed game in under a year.
