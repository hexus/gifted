Gifted - Online Multiplayer Flash Game

Attributes
	Health
		The red health bar denotes how much damage the character can withstand before perishing.
	Talent
		The blue talent bar determines how much of your power you can use at the current time.
		This will slowly regenerate by itself, but also by defeating enemies.
	Shield
		The light grey shield bar becomes visible when a protector gives you a shield.
		This effectively acts as an extension to your health bar.

Souls
	Every player character has a soul. Upon death they can be reborn at a safe haven but with a
	fraction of their soul destroyed. Souls can heal with soul fractures of the recently deceased.
	In order to be classed with a supernatural ability, they must find a powerful crystal and bind
	it to their unfractured soul. As a player uses their new abilities, their skill with that
	particular crystal increases permanently.
	
	Unbinding a crystal from a soul is difficult, and results in death, as well as the crystal
	being destroyed. However, if they have a different crystal to hand at this time, it can
	be used to revive them. Then, once they heal their soul they can bind the new crystal.
